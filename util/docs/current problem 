What type of data is expected by the simulator? Is the simulator expecting binary data?
Is it converting all numeric values from network byte order to host byte order?
How is it reading values from the byte array (Final structure) ?
---------------
New understanding :
------------------

i have to pass first "net header" because we are getting the size of the message which is "net_hdr + st_oe_reqres".
Task : Now, I have to apply structure chaining again. because i am pasing the byte array ofsize 338 (for board lot in)
which is containes everything (net_hdr and st_oe_reqres).

look into it . (we are passing the net_hdr . how we are going to pass st_oe_reqres)
