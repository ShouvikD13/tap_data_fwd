What type of data is expected by the simulator? Is the simulator expecting binary data?
Is it converting all numeric values from network byte order to host byte order?
How is it reading values from the byte array (Final structure) ?

## New understanding :

i have to pass first "net header" because we are getting the size of the message which is "net_hdr + st_oe_reqres".
Task : Now, I have to apply structure chaining again. because i am pasing the byte array ofsize 338 (for board lot in)
which is containes everything (net_hdr and st_oe_reqres).

look into it . (we are passing the net_hdr . how we are going to pass st_oe_reqres)

\*\* Auto reconnect logic . "what if we didn't want to implement the auto reconnect after first try "

// i have to fix the FnSendThrd and lookup the logic of DoxchngLogon.

Q. In System_info_data, i have to set Sequence number when i am packing the 'Net_HDR'. we usually fetchingg the Sequence number from the 'fsp' tabe . But here we are reading from some variable .
what should i do in this situation ??
For Now, I am Reading this from the Fsp Table .
